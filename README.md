### Inspiration
A friend's struggle with budgeting practices inspired the creation of this application. The idea was to build a tool for visually adding and tracking expenses and subscriptions.

### What it Does
The app offers features such as authentication, expense and subscription tracking, budget overview, and a statistics page. Its goal is to provide users with a comprehensive financial snapshot.

### How it Was Built
The project began with brainstorming the concept of a budget planner, followed by the creation of use cases. Backend APIs were then developed to support the required functionalities. Subsequently, the frontend was developed to interact with these APIs and visualize the application's capabilities.

### Challenges Faced
Implementing the subscription functionality posed challenges due to issues with how dates were handled. Through experimentation and troubleshooting, these issues were mostly resolved.

### Accomplishments We're Proud Of
The successful development of the web application and the visualization of entered data, including features like bar graphs, is a significant accomplishment.

### What We Learned
The project provided valuable experience in building MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) applications. This included extensive practice in developing backend APIs and applying knowledge from previous full-stack projects.

### What's Next for Budget Bud
Future plans for the application include adding additional functionalities such as a personal chatbot, the ability to download expenses within a specified period in PDF or Excel format, and implementing a level system.

### Built With
- Express.js
- MongoDB

### To Try Out
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` on both the frontend and backend directories.
3. Start the frontend with `npm start` and the backend with `npm run start`.

Note: If it's been a while, the database might have been deactivated.
